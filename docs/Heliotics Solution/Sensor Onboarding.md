# Sensor not responding or Showing wrong data 

If the sensor is not functioning properly, the issue might be caused by one of the following:

* Dirty sensor: Sensor might be dirty or covered with dust particles, try cleaning it carefully to ensure proper functionality.
* Sensor Misalignment: Sensor or mounting bracket could be slightly tilted. Check the alignment and adjust if necessary.
* Incorrect placement: If the sensor is placed inside tank (PET, CAN, OIL) and the tank is not correctly attached it may not
* work correctly. Double check if the top of the tank is closed correctly. 
* Sensor not communicating with LoRaWAN Gateway: Make sure that LoRaWAN Gateway is functional and connected to the network. 
In case of NB-IoT solution make sure you did not run out of mobile network data.
* Damaged sensor: Although rare, ItÂ´s possible that the sensor itself is damaged. If all other troubleshooting steps fail,
please contact us for further assistance.
