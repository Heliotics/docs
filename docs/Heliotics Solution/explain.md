# Understand in Seconds

We use something called IoT which stands for Internet of Things. This technology gives superpowers to everyday things like
machines, water tanks and other objects to talk and send information to your phone or computer. This helps people make better
decisions and save time, money and resources. 

# What makes Heliotics special:
* Smart sensors: These are devices that can sense things like temperature, water levels or even how full a trash bin is.
* LoRaWAN technology: This is technology that helps sensors to communicate with us. It´s like sending messages over 
* super long distances without using much energy. 
* Heliotics core: We design easy to use dashboards so you can see all the data at once. It´s like checking the weather app
* but for your business or home. 

# What can Heliotics do for you ?

* Save energy: We help track how much electricity, water or gas you use. 
* Keep tanks full: Whether It´s water, oil or grain, our smart tank monitors ensure you never run out.ň
* Preventive maintenance: We keep eye on machines to prevent breakdown and improve efficiency.
* Manage waste: Our sensors can tell when the trash bins are full and help cities plan better collection routes. 
* Smart Home/Office: Monitor temperature, climate, movement, humidity in rooms

# The Problems We´re Solving 

* Wasting money and resources: Sometimes lights, machines or water keeps running when no one needs them. Smart sensors keep
* track of how much energy is beind used and let people know how to save it. 
* Forgetting important things: People often forget to water plants, empty trash bins, refill tanks which can cause problems.
* Our sensors send alerts to your phone so you never forget !
* Machines breaking down: Machines stop suddenly working, and fixing them takes lot of time and money. We help spot small 
* problems early so they can be fixed before they become big problems.
* Hard to Check Places: It´s tricky to know what´s happening in faraway places like tanks, production halls or where your
* vehichles or goods are moving. Long range sensors send updates, even from faraway places, so you can check everything from
* your phone.
