# Sensor not responding or Showing wrong data
If the sensor is not functioning properly, the issue might be caused by one of the following:

* Dirty sensor: Sensor might be dirty or covered with dust particles, try cleaning it carefully to ensure proper functionality.
* Sensor Misalignment: Sensor or mounting bracket could be slightly tilted. Check the alignment and adjust if necessary.
* Incorrect placement: If the sensor is placed inside tank (PET, CAN, OIL) and the tank is not correctly attached it may not
* work correctly. Double check if the top of the tank is closed correctly.
* Sensor not communicating with LoRaWAN Gateway: Make sure that LoRaWAN Gateway is functional and connected to the network. In case of NB-IoT solution make sure you did not run out of mobile network data.
* Damaged sensor: Although rare, It´s possible that the sensor itself is damaged. 

If all other troubleshooting steps fail, please contact us for further assistance.

# What if there´s no LoRaWAN coverage in my are ?

We can create coverage by deploying gateways if needed. This ensures that even remote or hard to reach areas can benefit 
from our solutions. Also use of NB-IoT network can be an option. NB-IoT connects to the network of mobile operators, so 
there is no need to create LoRaWAN coverage.

# How secure is the data collected by your sensors

We prioritize security by using AES-128 encryption for all communications. Your data is securely transmitted and stored 
in compliance with industry standards.

# How do I update my devices ?

Most updates can be done over the air (OTA). Simply follow the instructions on your web or mobile app. (Toolbox)

# Can I integrate Heliotics Core with existing systems/devices ?

Yes, API integration makes connecting to other platforms and systems easy.

# My device is not showing accurate readings

Calibrate the sensor following the user manual or reset the device. For example if the sensor is placed in tank, It´s 
necessary to set exact measurements in [Heliotics app](https://core2.heliotics.com/) to display accurate readings. If needed, our technical team can assist 
remotely to fix this problem. 

# I´m not receiving data from my sensors

Ensure the sensors are within LoRaWAN coverage, LoRaWAN gateway is functioning correctly (indicator light should be green),
you have enough mobile data in cases of NB-IoT solution, battery has enough capacity. If the issue persists, contact us for 
troubleshooting.
